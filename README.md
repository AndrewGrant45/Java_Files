# Java_Tasks_&_Mini_Projects
This repository is full of Java files and functions I have worked on to better understand the Java Language. 

I am a 2nd year Mechanical Engineering and Management Student at McMaster University with a passion for coding and programing. In the future, I hope to integrate my passion for coding and programing with my mechanical engineering endeavors. My goal is to build a strong understanding with the basics of coding and programming. 

Each Branch is the different levels of Java tasks and mini projects I have created.
