# Java_Tasks
This repository is full of Java files and functions I have worked on to better understand the Java Language. 

I am a 2nd year Mechanical Engineering and Management Student at McMaster University with a passion for coding and programing. In the future, I hope to integrate my passion for coding and programing with my mechanical engineering endeavors. My goal is to build a strong understanding with the basics of coding and programming.
